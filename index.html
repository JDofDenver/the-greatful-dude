            <p class="firstParagraph">In December I decided to focus on re-training in Software Development. Below is a couple of the projects where I felt that i've learnt the most. From following the pre-work from FlatIron school, and self learning bits through CodeCademy, I've managed to take the small projects I have been given and expand them slightly. There's still a long way to go, and I'm very excited about learning and eventually starting my career in this space. I'll put a Paragraph next to each of the two projects I've chosen to explain the original task and how I adapted it.</p>

            <div class="disappear">In this exercise I have selected the picture of slimer from Ghostbusters using the Javascript selector method. I have created an event listerner to make Slimer disappear when the mouse is hovered over him. Move your mouse over the image of Slimer to see him disappear.</div>

                <h2>Playing with JavaScript</h2>
                <p>The last project I had was to move thisgs with JavaScript. In this assignement I had to make a white block (div) move from left to right using the arrow keys. I managed to do this by setting up an event listener and linking it to an action. I took this project further by making the block look like a Pac-Man ghost and enabling it to move up and down also. You can check out this project by clicking the Ghost image to the right.</p>
