            <p class="firstParagraph">In December, I decided to focus on re-training in Software Development. Below are a couple of the projects where I felt that I learned the most. From following the pre-work from FlatIron school, and self-learning through CodeCademy, I've managed to take the small projects I have been given and expand them slightly. There's still a long way to go, and I'm very excited about learning and eventually starting my career in this space. I'll put a Paragraph next to each of the two projects I've chosen to explain the original task and how I adapted it.</p>

                <p>In this exercise, I have selected the picture of Slimer from Ghostbusters. Using the Javascript selector method, I've created an event listener to make Slimer disappear when the image is clicked. Click on the image of Slimer to see him disappear. When you want him to appear again, just click anywhere on this block of writing.</p>

                <h2>Playing with JavaScript</h2>
                <p>The last project I had was to move thisgs with JavaScript. In this assignement I had to make a white block (div) move from left to right using the arrow keys. I managed to do this by setting up an event listener and linking it to an action. I took this project further by making the block look like a Pac-Man ghost and enabling it to move up and down also. You can check out this project by clicking the Ghost image to the right.</p>

            <h2>Things I've learned making this page.</h2>
            <p>In making this page, I've attempted to put together the skills I have learned so far into one project. 
                In making the page look better, I have learned about adding margins and padding to elements on the page, and subtle changes in the CSS, such as making the pointer change to a finger while hovering over an element that contains a link or action. 
                This project was created using HTML to structure it, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to give it actions.</p>
